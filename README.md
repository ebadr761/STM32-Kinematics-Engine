# STM32-Kinematics-Engine
My objective is to build a real-time, deterministic velocity estimator for athletic performance using bare-metal C++ and MEMS sensors. I'll use a STM32 Nucleo (I have the F411RE) and perhaps a separate unit to help measure acceleration (MPU6050 IMU).

My reasoning behind this idea involves my exposure to weight training recently, specifically how to measure "explosiveness" rather than just raw strength. The goal is "Velocity Based Training"—basically, I need to know if I’m moving the bar fast enough (around 1.0 m/s) to actually build athletic power. The problem is, I can't feel the difference between 0.7 m/s and 0.9 m/s, and I don't want to buy an expensive commercial tool which is used by athletes (VBT training device) so I’m going to build my own and call it a "Kinematics Engine." I want a small embedded device that I can strap to the barbell that calculates my velocity in real-time and gives me instant feedback—green light if I was fast enough, red light if I was too slow.

I’m going to use an STM32 microcontroller because I need precise, deterministic timing that I just can't get from simpler boards. I plan to write this in C++ using a "bare metal" approach—bypassing the standard helper libraries—so I can fully control the hardware registers. The first step is just getting the board to talk to an MPU6050 accelerometer over I2C to get the raw force data.

The tricky part is going to be the math. Accelerometers only give me force, so I have to mathematically integrate that data to get velocity. If my timing is off by a fraction of a millisecond, the errors will pile up and the data will be useless. To solve this, I’m going to use hardware timers to trigger interrupts exactly 100 or 1000 times a second, ensuring my physics calculations happen at a perfect rhythm. Once that's working, I’ll try to optimize it by using DMA (Direct Memory Access), which should allow the sensor to dump data directly into the chip's memory without the CPU having to baby-sit every single byte. If it works, I’ll have a super-efficient, real-time physics engine that is also durable enough to be running right on the metal.
